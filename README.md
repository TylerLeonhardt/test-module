# test-module

This is a dummy module used to test out functionality of GitHub Actions.

Shout to @devblackops for his PSScriptAnalyzer action!

The yml is located [here](https://github.com/TylerLeonhardt/test-module/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml).

It will:
- Run PSSA
- "Build" by running Pester tests
- Publish artifacts for each platform
